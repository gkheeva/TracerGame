#Tracer Game

This is a game where the player has to follow the tiles on the board while racing against time. Every tile successfully followed will result in gaining more time which is also decreasing every second. The rate of descresse increases as time goes on, making the user follow the tiles faster and faster until they are no longer able to keep up. At this point the high score has been reached, which is measured in seconds survived.
